<p>A powerful programming language is more than just a means
for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as
a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus,
when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the
means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more
complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for
accomplishing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>primitive expressions</strong>, which represent the simplest entities the
language is concerned with,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>means of combination</strong>, by which compound elements are built from
simpler ones, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>means of abstraction</strong>, by which compound elements can be named and
manipulated as units.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements:
procedures and data. (Later we will discover
that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is ``stuff''
that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules
for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language
should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and
should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will deal only with simple
numerical data so that we can focus on the
rules for building
procedures.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_10">^[4]{.small}^</a>
In later chapters we will see that these same rules allow us to build
procedures to manipulate compound data as well.</p>
<h3 id="111--expressions"><a class="header" href="#111--expressions"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_1.1.1">1.1.1  Expressions</a></a></h3>
<h2 id="section1"><a class="header" href="#section1"><a id=section1></a>section1</a></h2>
<p>One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical
interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Imagine
that you are sitting at a computer terminal. You type an <em>expression</em>,
and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its
<em>evaluating</em> that expression.</p>
<p>One kind of primitive expression you might
type is a number. (More precisely, the expression that you type consists
of the numerals that represent the number in base 10.) If you present
Lisp with a number</p>
<p><code>486</code>\</p>
<p>the interpreter will respond by printing <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_11">^[5]{.small}^</a></p>
<p><em><code>486</code></em>\</p>
<p>Expressions representing numbers may be
combined with an expression representing a
primitive
procedure (such as <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>) to form a compound expression that
represents the application of the procedure to those numbers. For
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ 137 349)
</code></pre>
<p>486</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(- 1000 334)
</code></pre>
<p>666</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(* 5 99)
</code></pre>
<p>495</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(/ 10 5)
</code></pre>
<p>2</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ 2.7 10)
</code></pre>
<p>12.7</p>
<p>Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of
expressions within parentheses in order to denote
procedure application, are called <em>combinations</em>. The
leftmost element in the list is called the <em>operator</em>, and
the other elements are called <em>operands</em>. The
value of a combination is obtained by applying the
procedure specified by the operator to the <em>arguments</em>
that are the values of the operands.</p>
<p>The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands is
known as <em>prefix notation</em>, and it may be somewhat
confusing at first because it departs significantly from the customary
mathematical convention. Prefix notation has several advantages,
however. One of them is that it can accommodate
procedures that may take an arbitrary number
of arguments, as in the following examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ 21 35 12 7)
</code></pre>
<p>75</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(* 25 4 12)
</code></pre>
<p>1200</p>
<p>No ambiguity can arise, because the operator is always the leftmost
element and the entire combination is delimited by the parentheses.</p>
<p>A second advantage of prefix notation is that it extends
in a straightforward way to allow combinations to be <em>nested</em>, that is,
to have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
</code></pre>
<p>19</p>
<p>There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to the
overall complexity of the expressions that the Lisp interpreter can
evaluate. It is we humans who get confused by still relatively simple
expressions such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable"></code></pre>
<p>which the interpreter would readily evaluate to be 57. We can help
ourselves by writing such an expression in the form</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ (* 3
      (+ (* 2 4)
         (+ 3 5)))
   (+ (- 10 7)
      6))
</code></pre>
<p>following a formatting convention known as
<em>pretty-printing</em>, in which each long combination is
written so that the operands are aligned vertically. The resulting
indentations display clearly the structure of the
expression.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_12">^[6]{.small}^</a></p>
<p>Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in the
same basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal, evaluates
the expression, and prints the result. This mode of operation is often
expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a
<em>read-eval-print loop</em>. Observe in
particular that it is not necessary to explicitly instruct the
interpreter to print the value of the
expression.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_13">^[7]{.small}^</a></p>
<h3 id="112--naming-and-the-environment"><a class="header" href="#112--naming-and-the-environment"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_1.1.2">1.1.2  Naming and the Environment</a></a></h3>
<p>A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for
using names to refer to computational objects. We say that
the name identifies a <em>variable</em> whose
<em>value</em> is the object.</p>
<p>In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with
<code>define</code>. Typing</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define size 2)
</code></pre>
<p>causes the interpreter to associate the value 2 with the name
<code>size</code>.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_14">^[8]{.small}^</a>
Once the name <code>size</code> has been associated with the number 2, we can refer
to the value 2 by name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">size
</code></pre>
<p>2</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(* 5 size)
</code></pre>
<p>10</p>
<p>Here are further examples of the use of <code>define</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define pi 3.14159)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define radius 10)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(* pi (* radius radius))
</code></pre>
<p>314.159</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define circumference (* 2 pi radius))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">circumference
</code></pre>
<p>62.8318</p>
<p><code>Define</code> is our language's simplest means of abstraction,
for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound
operations, such as the <code>circumference</code> computed above. In general,
computational objects may have very complex structures, and it would be
extremely inconvenient to have to remember and repeat their details each
time we want to use them. Indeed, complex programs are constructed by
building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity.
The interpreter makes this step-by-step program construction
particularly convenient because name-object associations can be created
incrementally in successive interactions. This feature encourages the
incremental development and testing of
programs and is largely responsible for the fact that a
Lisp program usually consists of a large number of relatively simple
procedures.</p>
<p>It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with
symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must
maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs.
This memory is called the <em>environment</em> (more precisely
the <em>global environment</em>, since we will see later that a
computation may involve a number of different
environments).<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_15">^[9]{.small}^</a></p>
<h3 id="113-evaluating-combinations"><a class="header" href="#113-evaluating-combinations"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_1.1.3">1.1.3	Evaluating Combinations</a></a></h3>
<p>One of our goals in this chapter is to
isolate issues about thinking procedurally. As a case in point, let us
consider that, in evaluating combinations, the interpreter is itself
following a procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>To evaluate a combination, do the following:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost
subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of
the other subexpressions (the operands).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes
in general. First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to
accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first
perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus,
the evaluation rule is <em>recursive</em> in nature; that is, it
includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule
itself.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_16">^[10]{.small}^</a></p>
<p>Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to
express what, in the case of a deeply nested combination, would
otherwise be viewed as a rather complicated process. For example,
evaluating</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(* (+ 2 (* 4 6))
   (+ 3 5 7))
</code></pre>
<p>requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different
combinations. We can obtain a picture of this process by
representing the combination in the form of a
tree, as shown in
figure	<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_fig_1.1">1.1</a>. Each combination is
represented by a node with branches
corresponding to the operator and the operands of the combination
stemming from it. The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with
no branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers.
Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the values
of the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and
then combining at higher and higher levels. In general, we shall see
that recursion is a very powerful technique for dealing with
hierarchical, treelike objects. In fact, the ``percolate values
upward'' form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind
of process known as <em>tree accumulation</em>.</p>
<p><img src="ch1-Z-G-1.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.1:</strong>	Tree representation, showing the value of each
subcombination.</p>
<p>Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us
to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive
expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names. We
take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that</p>
<ul>
<li>the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,</li>
<li>the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences
that carry out the corresponding operations, and</li>
<li>the values of other names are the objects associated with those names
in the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by
stipulating that symbols such as <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are also included in the
global environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine
instructions that are their ``values.'' The key point to notice is
the role of the environment in determining the meaning of
the symbols in expressions. In an interactive language such as Lisp, it
is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as <code>(+ x 1)</code>
without specifying any information about the environment that would
provide a meaning for the symbol	<code>x</code> (or even for the symbol <code>+</code>). As we
shall see in chapter	3, the general notion of the environment as
providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an
important role in our understanding of program execution.</p>
<p>Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not
handle definitions. For instance, evaluating <code>(define x 3)</code> does not
apply <code>define</code> to two arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol
<code>x</code> and the other of which is 3, since the purpose of the <code>define</code> is
precisely to associate <code>x</code> with a value. (That is, <code>(define x 3)</code> is not
a combination.)</p>
<p>Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called
<em>special forms</em>. <code>Define</code> is the only example of a special form that we
have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly. Each
special form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of
expressions (each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the
syntax of the programming language. In comparison with
most other programming languages, Lisp has a very simple syntax; that
is, the evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple
general rule together with specialized rules for a small number of
special
forms.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_17">^[11]{.small}^</a></p>

powerful programming language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and procedures.</li>
<li>Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations.</li>
<li>Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited means
of abstraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will learn about <em>procedure definitions</em>, a much
more powerful abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be
given a name and then referred to as a unit.</p>
<p>We begin by examining how to express the idea of ``squaring.'' We
might say, ``To square something, multiply it by itself.'' This is
expressed in our language as</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (square x) (* x x))
</code></pre>
<p>We can understand this in the following way:</p>
<p><code>(define (square  x)        (*         x     x))</code>\</p>
<p>To square something, multiply it by itself.</p>
<p>We have here a <em>compound procedure</em>, which
has been given the name <code>square</code>. The procedure represents the operation
of multiplying something by itself. The thing to be multiplied is given
a local name, <code>x</code>, which plays the same role that a pronoun plays in
natural language. Evaluating
the definition creates this compound procedure and associates it with
the name
<code>square</code>.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_18">^[12]{.small}^</a></p>
<p>The general form of a procedure definition
is</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (&lt;`*`name`*`&gt; &lt;`*`formal parameters`*`&gt;) &lt;`*`body`*`&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>The &lt;<em>name</em>&gt; is a symbol to be associated
with the procedure definition in the
environment.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_19">^[13]{.small}^</a>
The &lt;<em>formal parameters</em>&gt; are the names
used within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding
arguments of the procedure. The &lt;<em>body</em>&gt;
is an expression that will yield the value of the procedure application
when the formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to which
the procedure is
applied.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_20">^[14]{.small}^</a>
The &lt;<em>name</em>&gt; and the &lt;<em>formal parameters</em>&gt; are grouped within
parentheses, just as they would be in an actual call to
the procedure being defined.</p>
<p>Having defined <code>square</code>, we can now use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(square 21)
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>441</code></em><br />
\</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(square (+ 2 5))
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>49</code></em><br />
\</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(square (square 3))
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>81</code></em>\</p>
<p>We can also use <code>square</code> as a building block in defining other
procedures. For example, <em>x</em>^2^ + <em>y</em>^2^ can be expressed as</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ (square x) (square y))
</code></pre>
<p>We can easily define a procedure <code>sum-of-squares</code> that, given any two
numbers as arguments, produces the sum of their squares:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sum-of-squares 3 4)
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>25</code></em>\</p>
<p>Now we can use <code>sum-of-squares</code> as a building block in constructing
further procedures:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (f a)
  (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(f 5)
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>136</code></em></p>
<p>Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as
primitive procedures. Indeed, one could not tell by looking at the
definition of <code>sum-of-squares</code> given above whether <code>square</code> was built
into the interpreter, like <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>, or defined as a compound
procedure.</p>
<h3 id="115--the-substitution-model-for-procedure-application"><a class="header" href="#115--the-substitution-model-for-procedure-application"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_1.1.5">1.1.5  The Substitution Model for Procedure Application</a></a></h3>
<p>To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound
procedure, the interpreter follows much the same process as for
combinations whose operators name primitive procedures, which we
described in section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.3">1.1.3</a>. That is, the
interpreter evaluates the elements of the combination and applies the
procedure (which is the value of the operator of the combination) to the
arguments (which are the values of the operands of the combination).</p>
<p>We can assume that the mechanism for applying primitive procedures to
arguments is built into the interpreter. For compound procedures, the
application process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the
procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding
argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate this process, let's evaluate the combination</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(f 5)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>f</code> is the procedure defined in
section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.4">1.1.4</a>. We begin by retrieving
the body of <code>f</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))
</code></pre>
<p>Then we replace the formal parameter <code>a</code> by the argument 5:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
</code></pre>
<p>Thus the problem reduces to the evaluation of a combination with two
operands and an operator <code>sum-of-squares</code>. Evaluating this combination
involves three subproblems. We must evaluate the operator to get the
procedure to be applied, and we must evaluate the operands to get the
arguments. Now <code>(+ 5 1)</code> produces 6 and <code>(* 5 2)</code> produces 10, so we
must apply the <code>sum-of-squares</code> procedure to 6 and 10. These values are
substituted for the formal parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the body of
<code>sum-of-squares</code>, reducing the expression to</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ (square 6) (square 10))
</code></pre>
<p>If we use the definition of <code>square</code>, this reduces to</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
</code></pre>
<p>which reduces by multiplication to</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+ 36 100)
</code></pre>
<p>and finally to</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">136
</code></pre>
<p>The process we have just described is called the <em>substitution model</em>
for procedure application. It can be taken as a model that determines
the ``meaning'' of procedure application, insofar as the procedures
in this chapter are concerned. However, there are two points that should
be stressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure
application, not to provide a description of how the interpreter
really works. Typical interpreters do not evaluate procedure
applications by manipulating the text of a procedure to substitute
values for the formal parameters. In practice, the
``substitution'' is accomplished by using a local environment for
the formal parameters. We will discuss this more fully in chapters 3
and 4 when we examine the implementation of an interpreter in detail.</li>
<li>Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of
increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating
with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler in
chapter 5. The substitution model is only the first of these models
-- a way to get started thinking formally about the evaluation
process. In general, when modeling phenomena in science
and engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models. As we
examine things in greater detail, these simple models become
inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models. The
substitution model is no exception. In particular, when we address in
chapter 3 the use of procedures with ``mutable data,'' we will see
that the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by a more
complicated model of procedure
application.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_21">^[15]{.small}^</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="applicative-order-versus-normal-order"><a class="header" href="#applicative-order-versus-normal-order"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_22">Applicative order versus normal order</a></a></h4>
<p>According to the description of evaluation given in
section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.3">1.1.3</a>, the interpreter first
evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting
procedure to the resulting arguments. This is not the only way to
perform evaluation. An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate
the operands until their values were needed. Instead it would first
substitute operand expressions for parameters until it obtained an
expression involving only primitive operators, and would then perform
the evaluation. If we used this method, the evaluation of</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(f 5)
</code></pre>
<p>would proceed according to the sequence of expansions</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+    (square (+ 5 1))      (square (* 5 2))  )
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+    (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1))   (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))
</code></pre>
<p>followed by the reductions</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+         (* 6 6)             (* 10 10))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(+           36                   100)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">                    136
</code></pre>
<p>This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the
process is different. In particular, the evaluations of <code>(+ 5 1)</code> and
<code>(* 5 2)</code> are each performed twice here, corresponding to the reduction
of the expression</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(* x x)
</code></pre>
<p>with <code>x</code> replaced respectively by <code>(+ 5 1)</code> and <code>(* 5 2)</code>.</p>
<p>This alternative ``fully expand and then reduce'' evaluation method
is known as <em>normal-order evaluation</em>, in contrast to the
``evaluate the arguments and then apply'' method that the
interpreter actually uses, which is called
<em>applicative-order evaluation</em>. It can be shown that, for
procedure applications that can be modeled using substitution (including
all the procedures in the first two chapters of this book) and that
yield legitimate values, normal-order and applicative-order evaluation
produce the same value. (See exercise <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_thm_1.5">1.5</a>
for an instance of an ``illegitimate'' value where normal-order and
applicative-order evaluation do not give the same result.)</p>
<p>Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation,
partly because of the additional efficiency obtained from avoiding
multiple evaluations of expressions such as those illustrated with
<code>(+ 5 1)</code> and <code>(* 5 2)</code> above and, more significantly, because
normal-order evaluation becomes much more complicated to deal with when
we leave the realm of procedures that can be modeled by substitution. On
the other hand, normal-order evaluation can be an extremely valuable
tool, and we will investigate some of its implications in chapters 3 and
4.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_23">^[16]{.small}^</a></p>
<h3 id="116--conditional-expressions-and-predicates"><a class="header" href="#116--conditional-expressions-and-predicates"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_1.1.6">1.1.6  Conditional Expressions and Predicates</a></a></h3>
<p>The expressive power of the class of procedures that we can define at
this point is very limited, because we have no way to make tests and to
perform different operations depending on the result of a test. For
instance, we cannot define a procedure that computes the
absolute value of a number by testing whether the number
is positive, negative, or zero and taking different actions in the
different cases according to the rule</p>
<p><img src="ch1-Z-G-2.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>This construct is called a <em>case analysis</em>, and there is a
special form in Lisp for notating such a case analysis. It is called
<code>cond</code> (which stands for
``conditional''), and it is used as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (abs x)
  (cond ((&gt; x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((&lt; x 0) (- x))))
</code></pre>
<p>The general form of a conditional expression is</p>
<p><code>(cond (&lt;</code><em><code>p</code><del><code>1</code></del></em><code>&gt; &lt;</code><em><code>e</code><del><code>1</code></del></em><code>&gt;)</code><br />
<code>      (&lt;</code><em><code>p</code><del><code>2</code></del></em><code>&gt; &lt;</code><em><code>e</code><del><code>2</code></del></em><code>&gt;)</code><br />
<code>      </code><img src="book-Z-G-D-18.gif" alt="" /><br />
<code>      (&lt;</code><em><code>p</code>~</em><code>n</code><em>~</em><code>&gt; &lt;</code><em><code>e</code>~</em><code>n</code><em>~</em><code>&gt;))</code>\</p>
<p>consisting of the symbol <code>cond</code> followed by parenthesized
pairs of expressions <code>(&lt;</code><em><code>p</code></em><code>&gt; &lt;</code><em><code>e</code></em><code>&gt;)</code> called
<em>clauses</em>. The first expression in each pair
is a <em>predicate</em> -- that is, an expression whose value is
interpreted as either true or
false.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_24">^[17]{.small}^</a></p>
<p>Conditional expressions are evaluated as
follows. The predicate &lt;<em>p~1~</em>&gt; is evaluated first. If its value is
false, then &lt;<em>p~2~</em>&gt; is evaluated. If &lt;<em>p~2~</em>&gt;'s value is also
false, then &lt;<em>p~3~</em>&gt; is evaluated. This process continues until a
predicate is found whose value is true, in which case the interpreter
returns the value of the corresponding <em>consequent
expression</em> &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; of the clause as the value of the conditional
expression. If none of the &lt;<em>p</em>&gt;'s is found to be true, the value of
the <code>cond</code> is undefined.</p>
<p>The word <em>predicate</em> is used for procedures that return
true or false, as well as for expressions that evaluate to true or
false. The absolute-value procedure <code>abs</code> makes use of the
primitive
predicates <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and
<code>=</code>.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_25">^[18]{.small}^</a>
These take two numbers as arguments and test whether the first number
is, respectively, greater than, less than, or equal to the second
number, returning true or false accordingly.</p>
<p>Another way to write the absolute-value procedure is</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (abs x)
  (cond ((&lt; x 0) (- x))
        (else x)))
</code></pre>
<p>which could be expressed in English as ``If <em>x</em> is less than zero
return - <em>x</em>; otherwise return <em>x</em>.'' <code>Else</code> is a
special symbol that can be used in place of the &lt;<em>p</em>&gt; in the final
clause of a <code>cond</code>. This causes the <code>cond</code> to return as its value the
value of the corresponding &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; whenever all previous clauses have
been bypassed. In fact, any expression that always evaluates to a true
value could be used as the &lt;<em>p</em>&gt; here.</p>
<p>Here is yet another way to write the absolute-value procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (abs x)
  (if (&lt; x 0)
      (- x)
      x))
</code></pre>
<p>This uses the special form
<code>if</code>, a restricted type of conditional that can be used when there are
precisely two cases in the case analysis. The general form
of an <code>if</code> expression is</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(if &lt;`*`predicate`*`&gt; &lt;`*`consequent`*`&gt; &lt;`*`alternative`*`&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>To evaluate an <code>if</code>
expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the
&lt;<em>predicate</em>&gt; part of the expression. If the
&lt;<em>predicate</em>&gt; evaluates to a true value, the interpreter then
evaluates the &lt;<em>consequent</em>&gt; and returns its value.
Otherwise it evaluates the &lt;<em>alternative</em>&gt; and returns
its
value.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_26">^[19]{.small}^</a></p>
<p>In addition to primitive predicates such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>=</code>, and <code>&gt;</code>, there are
logical composition operations, which enable us to construct compound
predicates. The three most frequently used are these:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>
<p><code>(and &lt;</code><em><code>e</code><del><code>1</code></del></em><code>&gt; ``...`` &lt;</code><em><code>e</code>~</em><code>n</code><em>~</em><code>&gt;)</code></p>
<p>The interpreter evaluates the expressions &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; one at a time, in
left-to-right order. If any &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; evaluates to false, the value of
the <code>and</code> expression is false, and the rest of the &lt;<em>e</em>&gt;'s are not
evaluated. If all &lt;<em>e</em>&gt;'s evaluate to true values, the value of the
<code>and</code> expression is the value of the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(or &lt;</code><em><code>e</code><del><code>1</code></del></em><code>&gt; ``...`` &lt;</code><em><code>e</code>~</em><code>n</code><em>~</em><code>&gt;)</code></p>
<p>The interpreter evaluates the expressions &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; one at a time, in
left-to-right order. If any &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; evaluates to a true value, that
value is returned as the value of the <code>or</code> expression, and the rest of
the &lt;<em>e</em>&gt;'s are not evaluated. If all &lt;<em>e</em>&gt;'s evaluate to false,
the value of the <code>or</code> expression is false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(not &lt;</code><em><code>e</code></em><code>&gt;)</code></p>
<p>The value of a <code>not</code> expression is true when the expression &lt;<em>e</em>&gt;
evaluates to false, and false otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are special
forms, not procedures, because the subexpressions are not necessarily
all evaluated. <code>Not</code> is an ordinary procedure.</p>
<p>As an example of how these are used, the condition that a number <em>x</em> be
in the range 5 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 10 may be expressed as</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(and (&gt; x 5) (&lt; x 10))
</code></pre>
<p>As another example, we can define a predicate to test whether one number
is greater than or equal to another as</p>
<p><code>(define (&gt;= x y)</code><br />
<code>  (or (&gt; x y) (= x y)))</code>\</p>
<p>or alternatively as</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (&gt;= x y)
  (not (&lt; x y)))
</code></pre>

Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is

<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(test 0 (p))
</code></pre>
<p>What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses
applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an
interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer.
(Assume that the evaluation rule for the
special form <code>if</code> is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the
result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative
expression.)</p>

<p>Procedures, as introduced above, are much
like ordinary mathematical functions. They specify a value that is
determined by one or more parameters. But there is an important
difference between mathematical functions and computer procedures.
Procedures must be effective.</p>
<p>As a case in point, consider the problem of computing square roots. We
can define the square-root function as</p>
<p><img src="ch1-Z-G-4.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>This describes a perfectly legitimate mathematical function. We could
use it to recognize whether one number is the square root of another, or
to derive facts about square roots in general. On the other hand, the
definition does not describe a procedure. Indeed, it tells us almost
nothing about how to actually find the square root of a given number. It
will not help matters to rephrase this definition in pseudo-Lisp:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt x)
  (the y (and (&gt;= y 0)
              (= (square y) x))))
</code></pre>
<p>This only begs the question.</p>
<p>The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the
general distinction between describing properties of things and
describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the
distinction between declarative knowledge
and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we
are usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas
in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to)
descriptions.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_32">^[20]{.small}^</a></p>
<p>How does one compute square roots? The most
common way is to use Newton's method of successive approximations,
which says that whenever we have a guess <em>y</em> for the value of the square
root of a number <em>x</em>, we can perform a simple manipulation to get a
better guess (one closer to the actual square root) by averaging <em>y</em>
with
<em>x</em>/<em>y</em>.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_33">^[21]{.small}^</a>
For example, we can compute the square root of 2 as follows. Suppose our
initial guess is 1:</p>
<hr />
<p>Guess    Quotient              Average</p>
<p>1        (2/1) = 2             ((2 + 1)/2) = 1.5</p>
<p>1.5      (2/1.5) = 1.3333      ((1.3333 + 1.5)/2) = 1.4167</p>
<p>1.4167   (2/1.4167) = 1.4118   ((1.4167 + 1.4118)/2) = 1.4142</p>
<p>1.4142   <code>...</code>                 <code>...</code></p>
<hr />
<p>Continuing this process, we obtain better and better approximations to
the square root.</p>
<p>Now let's formalize the process in terms of procedures. We start with a
value for the radicand (the number whose square root we
are trying to compute) and a value for the guess. If the guess is good
enough for our purposes, we are done; if not, we must repeat the process
with an improved guess. We write this basic strategy as a procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))
</code></pre>
<p>A guess is improved by averaging it with the quotient of the radicand
and the old guess:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
</code></pre>
<p>where</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
</code></pre>
<p>We also have to say what we mean by ``good enough.'' The following
will do for illustration, but it is not really a very good test. (See
exercise
<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_thm_1.7">1.7</a>.) The idea is to improve the
answer until it is close enough so that its square differs from the
radicand by less than a predetermined tolerance (here
0.001):<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_34">^[22]{.small}^</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define
(good-enough?
guess
x)

(&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need a way to get started. For instance, we can always guess
that the square root of any number is
1:<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_35">^[23]{.small}^</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
</code></pre>
<p>If we type these definitions to the interpreter, we can use <code>sqrt</code> just
as we can use any procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sqrt	9)
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>3.00009155413138</code></em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sqrt	(+ 100	37))

<p><em><code>11.704699917758145</code></em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(sqrt	(+ (sqrt	2)	(sqrt	3)))
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>1.7739279023207892</code></em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(square	(sqrt	1000))
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>1000.000369924366</code></em></p>
<p>The <code>sqrt</code> program also illustrates that the simple
procedural language we have introduced so far is sufficient for writing
any purely numerical program that one could write in, say, C or Pascal.
This might seem surprising, since we have not included in our language
any iterative (looping) constructs that direct the
computer to do something over and over again. <code>Sqrt-iter</code>, on the other
hand, demonstrates how iteration can be accomplished using no special
construct other than the ordinary ability to call a
procedure.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_36">^[24]{.small}^</a></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.6.</strong>  Alyssa P.
Hacker doesn't see why <code>if</code> needs to be provided as a special form.
``Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of
<code>cond</code>?'' she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can
indeed be done, and she defines a new version of <code>if</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
</code></pre>
<p>Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>5</code></em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
</code></pre>
<p><em><code>0</code></em></p>
<p>Delighted, Alyssa uses <code>new-if</code> to rewrite the square-root program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
</code></pre>
<p>What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots?
Explain.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.7.</strong>  The <code>good-enough?</code> test used in
computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square
roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic
operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This
makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these
statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large
numbers. An alternative strategy for implementing <code>good-enough?</code> is to
watch how <code>guess</code> changes from one iteration to the next and to stop
when the change is a very small fraction of the guess. Design a
square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work
better for small and large numbers?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.8.</strong>  Newton's
method for cube roots is based on the fact that if <em>y</em> is an

<p>Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the

abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)</p>

<p><code>Sqrt</code> is our first example of a process defined by a set of mutually
defined procedures. Notice that the definition of <code>sqrt-iter</code> is
<em>recursive</em>; that is, the procedure is defined in terms of
itself. The idea of being able to define a procedure in terms of itself
may be disturbing; it may seem unclear how such a ``circular''
definition could make sense at all, much less specify a well-defined
process to be carried out by a computer. This will be addressed more
carefully in section <a href="book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2">1.2</a>. But first let's
consider some other important points illustrated by the <code>sqrt</code> example.</p>
<p>Observe that the problem of computing square roots breaks
up naturally into a number of subproblems: how to tell whether a guess
is good enough, how to improve a guess, and so on. Each of these tasks
is accomplished by a separate procedure. The entire <code>sqrt</code> program can
be viewed as a cluster of procedures (shown in
figure <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_fig_1.2">1.2</a>) that mirrors the decomposition
of the problem into subproblems.</p>
<p><img src="ch1-Z-G-6.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.2:</strong>  Procedural decomposition of the <code>sqrt</code> program.</p>
<p>The importance of this decomposition strategy is not
simply that one is dividing the program into parts. After all, we could
take any large program and divide it into parts -- the first ten lines,
the next ten lines, the next ten lines, and so on. Rather, it is crucial
that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used
as a module in defining other procedures. For example,
when we define the <code>good-enough?</code> procedure in terms of <code>square</code>, we are
able to regard the <code>square</code> procedure as a ``black
box.'' We are not at that moment concerned with <em>how</em> the procedure
computes its result, only with the fact that it computes the square. The
details of how the square is computed can be suppressed, to be
considered at a later time. Indeed, as far as the <code>good-enough?</code>
procedure is concerned, <code>square</code> is not quite a procedure but rather an
abstraction of a procedure, a so-called
<em>procedural abstraction</em>. At this level of
abstraction, any procedure that computes the square is equally good.</p>
<p>Thus, considering only the values they return, the following two
procedures for squaring a number should be indistinguishable. Each takes
a numerical argument and produces the square of that number as the
value.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_40">^[25]{.small}^</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (square x) (* x x))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (square x)
  (exp (double (log x))))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (double x) (+ x x))
</code></pre>
<p>So a procedure definition should be able to suppress detail. The users
of the procedure may not have written the procedure themselves, but may
have obtained it from another programmer as a black box. A user should
not need to know how the procedure is implemented in order to use it.</p>
<h4 id="local-names"><a class="header" href="#local-names"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_41">Local names</a></a></h4>
<p>One detail of a procedure's implementation that should
not matter to the user of the procedure is the implementer's choice of
names for the procedure's formal parameters. Thus, the following
procedures should not be distinguishable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (square x) (* x x))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (square y) (* y y))
</code></pre>
<p>This principle -- that the meaning of a procedure should be independent
of the parameter names used by its author -- seems on the surface to be
self-evident, but its consequences are profound. The simplest
consequence is that the parameter names of a procedure must be local to
the body of the procedure. For example, we used <code>square</code> in the
definition of <code>good-enough?</code> in our square-root procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
</code></pre>
<p>The intention of the author of <code>good-enough?</code> is to determine if the
square of the first argument is within a given tolerance of the second
argument. We see that the author of <code>good-enough?</code> used the name <code>guess</code>
to refer to the first argument and <code>x</code> to refer to the second argument.
The argument of <code>square</code> is <code>guess</code>. If the author of <code>square</code> used <code>x</code>
(as above) to refer to that argument, we see that the <code>x</code> in
<code>good-enough?</code> must be a different <code>x</code> than the one in <code>square</code>. Running
the procedure <code>square</code> must not affect the value of <code>x</code> that is used by
<code>good-enough?</code>, because that value of <code>x</code> may be needed by
<code>good-enough?</code> after <code>square</code> is done computing.</p>
<p>If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective
procedures, then the parameter <code>x</code> in <code>square</code> could be confused with
the parameter <code>x</code> in <code>good-enough?</code>, and the behavior of <code>good-enough?</code>
would depend upon which version of <code>square</code> we used. Thus, <code>square</code>
would not be the black box we desired.</p>
<p>A formal parameter of a procedure has a very
special role in the procedure definition, in that it doesn't matter
what name the formal parameter has. Such a name is called a
<em>bound variable</em>, and we say that the
procedure definition <em>binds</em> its formal parameters. The
meaning of a procedure definition is unchanged if a bound variable is
consistently renamed throughout the
definition.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_42">^[26]{.small}^</a>
If a variable is not bound, we say that it is
<em>free</em>. The set of expressions for which a
binding defines a name is called the <em>scope</em>
of that name. In a procedure definition, the bound variables declared as
the formal parameters of the
procedure have the body of the procedure as their scope.</p>
<p>In the definition of <code>good-enough?</code> above, <code>guess</code> and <code>x</code> are bound
variables but <code>&lt;</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>abs</code>, and <code>square</code> are free. The meaning of
<code>good-enough?</code> should be independent of the names we choose for <code>guess</code>
and <code>x</code> so long as they are distinct and different from <code>&lt;</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>abs</code>,
and <code>square</code>. (If we renamed <code>guess</code> to <code>abs</code> we would have introduced a
bug by <em>capturing</em> the
variable <code>abs</code>. It would have changed from free to bound.) The meaning
of <code>good-enough?</code> is not independent of the names of its free variables,
however. It surely depends upon the fact (external to this definition)
that the symbol <code>abs</code> names a procedure for computing the absolute value
of a number. <code>Good-enough?</code> will compute a different function if we
substitute <code>cos</code> for <code>abs</code> in its definition.</p>
<h4 id="internal-definitions-and-block-structure"><a class="header" href="#internal-definitions-and-block-structure"><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_43">Internal definitions and block structure</a></a></h4>
<p>We have one kind of name isolation available to us so far: The formal
parameters of a procedure are local to the body of the procedure. The
square-root program illustrates another way in which we would like to
control the use of names. The existing program consists of
separate procedures:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this program is that the only procedure that is
important to users of <code>sqrt</code> is <code>sqrt</code>. The other procedures
(<code>sqrt-iter</code>, <code>good-enough?</code>, and <code>improve</code>) only clutter up their
minds. They may not define any other procedure called <code>good-enough?</code> as
part of another program to work together with the square-root program,
because <code>sqrt</code> needs it. The problem is especially severe in the
construction of large systems by many separate programmers. For example,
in the construction of a large library of numerical procedures, many
numerical functions are computed as successive approximations and thus
might have procedures named <code>good-enough?</code> and <code>improve</code> as auxiliary
procedures. We would like to localize the subprocedures, hiding them
inside <code>sqrt</code> so that <code>sqrt</code> could coexist with other successive
approximations, each having its own private <code>good-enough?</code> procedure. To
make this possible, we allow a procedure to have
internal definitions that are local to that
procedure. For example, in the square-root problem we can write</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess x)
    (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess x)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    (if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
</code></pre>
<p>Such nesting of definitions, called <em>block structure</em>, is basically the
right solution to the simplest name-packaging problem. But there is a
better idea lurking here. In addition to internalizing the definitions
of the auxiliary procedures, we can simplify them. Since <code>x</code> is bound in
the definition of <code>sqrt</code>, the procedures <code>good-enough?</code>, <code>improve</code>, and
<code>sqrt-iter</code>, which are defined internally to <code>sqrt</code>, are in the scope of
<code>x</code>. Thus, it is not necessary to pass <code>x</code> explicitly to each of these
procedures. Instead, we allow <code>x</code> to be a
free variable in the internal definitions,
as shown below. Then <code>x</code> gets its value from the argument with which the
enclosing procedure <code>sqrt</code> is called. This discipline is called
<em>lexical
scoping</em>.<a href="book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_44">^[27]{.small}^</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme editable">(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess)
    (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess)
    (if (good-enough? guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0))

The characterization of numbers as ``simple data'' is a barefaced
bluff. In fact, the treatment of numbers is one of the trickiest and
most confusing aspects of any programming language. Some typical issues
involved are these: Some
computer systems distinguish <em>integers</em>, such as 2, from <em>real numbers</em>,
such as 2.71. Is the real number 2.00 different from the integer 2? Are
the arithmetic operations used for integers the same as the operations
used for real numbers? Does 6 divided by 2 produce 3, or 3.0? How large
a number can we represent? How many decimal places of accuracy can we
represent? Is the range of integers the same as the range of real
numbers? Above and beyond
these questions, of course, lies a collection of issues concerning
roundoff and truncation errors -- the entire science of numerical
analysis. Since our focus in this book is on large-scale program design
rather than on numerical techniques, we are going to ignore these
problems. The numerical examples in this chapter will exhibit the usual
roundoff behavior that one observes when using arithmetic operations
that preserve a limited number of decimal places of accuracy in
noninteger operations.</p>

Throughout this book, when we wish to emphasize the

Lisp systems typically provide features to

Lisp obeys the
convention that every expression has a value. This convention, together
with the old reputation of Lisp as an inefficient language, is the
source of the quip by Alan Perlis (paraphrasing Oscar Wilde) that
``Lisp programmers know the value of everything but the cost of
nothing.''</p>

It may seem strange that the evaluation rule says, as part of the first
step, that we should evaluate the leftmost element of a combination,
since at this point that can only be an operator such as <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>
representing a built-in primitive procedure such as addition or
multiplication. We will see later that it is useful to be able to work
with combinations whose operators are themselves compound expressions.</p>

Special
syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative surface
structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways are
sometimes called <em>syntactic sugar</em>, to use a phrase coined by Peter
Landin. In comparison with users of other languages, Lisp programmers,
as a rule, are less concerned with matters of syntax. (By contrast,
examine any Pascal manual and notice how much of it is devoted to
descriptions of syntax.) This disdain for syntax is due partly to the
flexibility of Lisp, which makes it easy to change surface syntax, and
partly to the observation that many ``convenient'' syntactic
constructs, which make the language less uniform, end up causing more
trouble than they are worth when programs become large and complex. In
the words of Alan Perlis, ``Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the
semicolon.''</p>

Observe that there are two different operations being combined here: we
are creating the procedure, and we are giving it the name <code>square</code>. It
is possible, indeed important, to be able to separate these two notions
-- to create procedures without naming them, and to give names to
procedures that have already been created. We will see how to do this in
section <a href="book-Z-H-12.html#%_sec_1.3.2">1.3.2</a>.</p>

Throughout this book, we will describe the
general syntax of expressions by using italic symbols delimited by angle
brackets -- e.g., &lt;<em>name</em>&gt; -- to denote the ``slots'' in the
expression to be filled in when such an expression is actually used.</p>
<p><a href="book-Z-H-10.html#call_footnote_Temp_20">^[14]{.small}^</a>
More generally, the body of the procedure can be a
sequence of expressions. In this case, the interpreter evaluates each
expression in the sequence in turn and returns the value of the final
expression as the value of the procedure application.</p>

Despite the simplicity of the substitution idea, it turns out to be
surprisingly complicated to give a rigorous mathematical definition of
the substitution process. The problem arises from the possibility of
confusion between the names used for the formal parameters of a
procedure and the (possibly identical) names used in the expressions to
which the procedure may be applied. Indeed, there is a long history of
erroneous definitions of <em>substitution</em> in the literature of logic and
programming semantics. See Stoy 1977 for a careful
discussion of substitution.</p>

In chapter 3 we will introduce <em>stream processing</em>, which is a way of

``Interpreted
as either true or false'' means this: In Scheme, there are two
distinguished values that are denoted by the constants <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>.
When the interpreter checks a predicate's value, it interprets <code>#f</code> as
false. Any other value is treated as true. (Thus, providing <code>#t</code> is
logically unnecessary, but it is convenient.) In this book we will use
names <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, which are associated with the values <code>#t</code> and
<code>#f</code> respectively.</p>
<p><a href="book-Z-H-10.html#call_footnote_Temp_25">^[18]{.small}^</a>

A minor difference between
<code>if</code> and <code>cond</code> is that the &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; part of each <code>cond</code> clause may be a
sequence of expressions. If the corresponding &lt;<em>p</em>&gt; is found to be
true, the expressions &lt;<em>e</em>&gt; are evaluated in sequence and the value of
the final expression in the sequence is returned as the value of the
<code>cond</code>. In an <code>if</code> expression, however, the &lt;<em>consequent</em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>alternative</em>&gt; must be single expressions.</p>

Declarative and imperative descriptions are intimately related, as
indeed are mathematics and computer science. For instance, to say that
the answer produced by a program is ``correct'' is to
make a declarative statement about the program. There is a large amount
of research aimed at establishing techniques for proving
that programs are correct, and much of the technical difficulty of this
subject has to do with negotiating the transition between imperative
statements (from which programs are constructed) and declarative
statements (which can be used to deduce things). In a related vein, an
important current area in programming-language design is the exploration
of so-called very high-level languages, in
which one actually programs in terms of declarative statements. The idea
is to make interpreters sophisticated enough so that, given ``what
is'' knowledge specified by the programmer, they can generate ``how
to'' knowledge automatically. This cannot be done in general, but
there are important areas where progress has been made. We shall revisit
this idea in chapter 4.</p>

Observe that we express our initial guess as 1.0 rather than 1. This
would not make any difference in many Lisp implementations.
MIT
Scheme, however, distinguishes between exact integers and decimal
values, and dividing two integers produces a rational number rather than
a decimal. For example, dividing 10 by 6 yields 5/3, while dividing 10.0
by 6.0 yields 1.6666666666666667. (We will learn how to implement
arithmetic on rational numbers in
section <a href="book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.) If we start with an
initial guess of 1 in our square-root program, and <em>x</em> is an exact
integer, all subsequent values produced in the square-root computation
will be rational numbers rather than decimals. Mixed operations on
rational numbers and decimals always yield decimals, so starting with an
initial guess of 1.0 forces all subsequent values to be decimals.</p>
